# Projects-TMA4320
Hi!
Here you can find projects that me and two fellow students worked on for the course work in the subject TMA4320 - "Introduction to Scientific Computation". 
The projects were inspired by problems from biophysics, physics and mathematics. They were written in Jupyter Notebooks, and files that end with .ipynb should also
be opened in Jupyter Notebook. These projects often contain a bit of theoretical framework, and might therefore appear a bit too theoretical.

If this is the case, I would urge you to take a look at the "Animations"-folders in "TMA4320-Teknisk fysikk" and "TMA4320-Industriell Matematikk", so that you can take a 
look at the intereseting results we got!
